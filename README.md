## Short Form Code of Conduct
The C.R Legacy Community is dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free space and experience for all community participants, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, socioeconomic status, body size, ethnicity, nationality, level of experience, age, religion (or lack thereof), or other identity markers. Our Code of Conduct exists because of that dedication, and we do not tolerate harassment in any form. Our full Code of Conduct can be found at this [link](#long-form-code-of-conduct).

If you cannot be bothered to read this whole thing, here is a nice and short summary: Be a good human, be nice, and help those that need help. This group is about learning and for improving our skills as a community in order to better ourselves. If that does not fit into what you want to talk about, there are better places on the internet for you to have those discussions.

## Long Form Code of Conduct
This Code of Conduct applies to EVERYONE in ALL C.R.L Community spaces, including:

- C.R.L Discord Server
- C.R.L open source repositories
- C.R.L Community events and meetups, online and offline
- one-on-one communications pertaining to C.R.L Community business.
Participants violating our Code of Conduct may be penalized or expelled at the discretion of community management.

Some C.R.L Community spaces may have additional rules in place, which are posted publicly for participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules. We invite all those who participate in the C.R.L Community to help us create safe and positive community experiences.

Consequences for noncompliance with the Code of Conduct may include a discussion with moderators, mediation with the participant you may have harassed, or as an absolute last resort, a ban from the community.

## Procedures

If you experience or witness (or have experienced or have witnessed) violations of the Code of Conduct or have any other concerns, please notify a member of the Management Team or Star Mentors on Discord, Reports of Code of Conduct violations should include as many details as possible, for example:

- Discord handles of people involved
- When and which channel(s) it happened
- Detailed summary of what happened
- Additional context / screenshots

## Enforcement

- Participants will be asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately, even if participants do not agree with or fully acknowledge the behavior being reported.

- If a participant violates the Code of Conduct, community moderators may take any action they deem appropriate to maintaining a welcoming environment for all participants, up to and including removing the participants messages, permissions or membership from the community.

### Moderators

### Code of Conduct moderators will:

- Behind the scenes there will always be at least two people working together to resolve violations.
- Respond as promptly as possible to reports of violations.
- Make an effort to understand both sides of the situation.
- Keep each other accountable.
- Recuse themselves or be excused from handling an incident if they are listed as a possible Code of Conduct violator.

## Additional Items

### Please also note:

- Moderators can choose to close threads or ask for a subject change.
- Moderators can choose to re-evaluate consequences.
- Do not delete posts or comments you’ve made unless:
  - You sincerely made the post in error (like accidentally posting in the wrong group, for example) and
  - Deleting will not interfere with group discussion. The specific problem we want to address with this rule: Deleting because the conversation has become tense or uncomfortable or to avoid taking responsibility is. Many of us are socialized or naturally prone to avoid conflict, but working through that conflict and acknowledging differing viewpoints is worth the discomfort.
- This Code of Conduct applies to C.R.L Community spaces and events, but if you are being or have been harassed by a C.R.L Community participant externally, you may still report to the C.R.L Community moderators. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by community participants seriously. The C.R.L moderators reserve the right to exclude people from the C.R.L Community and/or C.R.L events based on past and/or external behavior towards C.R.L Community participants or non-participants.
- We will not name harassment victims without their consent. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of the C.R.L Community or the general public.
